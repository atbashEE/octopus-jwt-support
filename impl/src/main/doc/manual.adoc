== Introduction

A first attempt for converting Java beans to and from a JWT.
The code will be improved when Atbash Octopus has full support for MP JWT Auth spec and OAuth2/OpenId Connect.

== Standard usage JWT Serialization

Convert the Object _data_ to JSON and Base64 encoded format.

----
    @Inject
    private JWTEncoder jwtEncoder;

    JWTParameters parameters = JWTParametersBuilder.newBuilderFor(JWTEncoding.NONE)
                .build();

    String encoded = jwtEncoder.encode(data, parameters);

----


Use the Object _data_ as JWT payload, signed with a HMAC

----
    @Inject
    private JWTEncoder jwtEncoder;

    JWTParameters parameters = JWTParametersBuilder.newBuilderFor(JWTEncoding.JWS)
                .withHeader("Octopus Offline", "v0.4")
                .withSecretKeyForSigning(HmacSecretUtil.generateSecretKey(LOCAL_SECRET_KEY_ID, localSecret))
                .build();

    String encoded = encoder.encode(data, parameters);

----

In the above example, the JWT has a custom header.


Instead of injecting the Encoder, it is also possible to instantiate the encoder directly.

----
   JWTEncoder jwtEncoder = new JWTEncoder();
----

Use the Object _data_ as payload within a JWE (first signed and then encrypted)

This examples uses an RSA for signing (private key) and encryption (public key).

----
    JWTParameters parameters = JWTParametersBuilder.newBuilderFor(JWTEncoding.JWE)
            .withSecretKeyForSigning(keyForSigning)
            .withSecretKeyForEncryption(keyForEncryption)
            .build();

    String encoded = new JWTEncoder().encode(data, parameters);
----

Converting the JWT (or Base64 encoded JSON) to an Object instance.

The following example converts a signed JWT or a JWE.

----
    @Inject
    private JWTDecoder jwtDecoder;

    @Inject
    private KeySelector keySelector;

    @Inject
    private MPBearerTokenVerifier verifier;

    JWTData<MPJWTToken> data = jwtDecoder.decode(token, MPJWTToken.class, keySelector, verifier);
    MPJWTToken token = data.getData();
----

KeySelector -> Selector of the key based on the id found in the header using a default (but can be configured) keyManager which looks for all keys defined based on some location (see _keys.location_ and _key.manager.class_ configuration parameters)

MPBearerTokenVerifier -> Optional verifier for validating the JWT.

TODO : Describe the default verifications.

== Keys

Retrieving a certain Cryptographic key can be performed by the class _KeySelector_ through the methods _selectAtbashKey_ and _selectSecretKey_.  You give it a few criteria (like key id, key type like RSA, EC, etc ..) and it tries to find the key which correspond to these values.

If it finds no key or multiple keys which match these criteria, you will see a warning in the log and the method returns null. Which will obviously result in a error in the calling method because it probably needs a key.

Most of the time, you give it the key id (and if you like the private of public part, see also further on why this is important) but you could also decide that the library can take the only available private key it knows of for creating the signature for instance.

You supply the criteria to match, through a _SelectorCriteria_ when can be created by a Builder pattern.

The filtering is performed in this order
- id
- secret key type (combination of type like RSA and part like private part)
- key type (RSA, EC, ...)
- part (is possible)

The _KeySelector_ however, is only responsible for selecting the matching key from the 'pool'. Managing (reading) the 'pool' is the responsibility of the _KeyManager_.

=== Providing the keys

The _KeyManager_ is responsible for supplying the requested key to the _KeySelector_. (when verifying signature, when decrypting and so on)

There is a default _KeyManager_ available called **LocalKeyManager** which is active when no specific configuration value is set (see further on or the configuration section in this manual).
It is capable of reading a specific file with keys, or directory with several key files. It can even read from an URL resource, but will be used most of the times to read it from a local (from the point of the server process) location like the classpath or file and directory.

If you need another implementation, like reading it from a central managed storage or reading keys in a more dynamic way, you can implement the interface _be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.KeyManager_.

In a CDI environment, you can define your custom _KeyManager_ as a CDI bean and it will be picked up. An other option is to define the class as parameter value of configuration parameter _key.manager.class_.  It must contain the fully qualified class name. It is just instantiated, so no CDI features (unless you use programmatic retrieval of beans) will be available.

The keys are read by the _KeyReader_ which has support for PEM, JKS (Java KeyStore), JWK, and JWKSet. (see <<Supported Key Formats>>)

=== Define Key type

By default, based on the file extension, the type is determined and how it should be read. There is a default implementation which makes the following mapping

- .jwk -> JWK
- .jwke -> JWK  (Atbash encrypted JWK)
- .jwks -> JWKSet
- .jwkset -> JWKSet
- .jwksete -> JWKSet  (Atbash encrypted JWKSet)
- .pem -> PEM
- .der -> PEM
- .jks -> KeyStore
- .p12 -> KeyStore
- .pfx -> KeyStore

When you want to use other suffixes, implement the interface _be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.reader.KeyResourceTypeProvider_ and define the class name as parameter value of key _key.resourcetype.provider.class_.

The return value of the interface method _determineKeyResourceType_ will determine how the resource will be read. Returning null means that the type is unknown

=== Supply passwords

Various types have encrypted storage of private keys (as they have a sensitive nature).

TODO Specify how _ConfigKeyResourcePasswordLookup_ reads the password from the configuration.

=== Customization

Password are by default read from configuration (parameter _lookup.password.class_ define the class)

KeyResourceTypeProvider -> defines mapping between file extension and type of key (PEM, JKS, ...)

== Supported Key Formats

    PEM
       PKCS8
       PKCS1
    JWK
    JWKSet
    Java KeyStore

== Generating Cryptographic key

With the class **be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.generator.KeyGenerator** you are able to generate cryptographic keys.

It is a CDI bean and can be injected into other CDI controlled classes. But you can also create a new instance of this class when you need to generation capabilities in other environments.

By calling the method

    generateKeys(GenerationParameters);

It will give you one or more keys, depending on the type you requested. For asymmetric keys, like RSA keys, you get the corresponding public and private keys.

The kind of keys which are generated, depend on the parameter you supply, which can be created using a builder pattern. The following example gives you the code for generating an RSA key.

        RSAGenerationParameters generationParameters = new RSAGenerationParameters.RSAGenerationParametersBuilder()
                .withKeyId("the-kid")
                .build();
        List<AtbashKey> atbashKeys = generator.generateKeys(generationParameters);

The default size of the generated key is 2048, but you can define it using the method _.withKeySize_ on the builder.

There are also builders for Elliptic Curve (EC) and Octec sequence (used in MAC and symmetric encryption) available.

The key id is always required and for EC keys, the curve name is also required.

The generation is performed by the JVM classes itself in case of the RSA and OCT keys, and BouncyCastle in the case of EC keys (_ECDSA_ algorithm)


== Writing Cryptographic key

With the class **be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.writer.KeyWriter** you can convert an _AtbashKey_ into one of the supported formats. See ??? for a list of the formats.

This class can also be used as CDI bean, and injected into other CDI artifacts, or used in other environments by instantiating it yourself.

With the method _writeKeyResource_, you can convert the _AtbashKey_, containing the Cryptographic key, into one of the formats as defined by the parameter **KeyResourceType**.

There are 2 variants for the method. One contains a String value defining the location where it key will be stored, the other one just returns the result as a byte array.

When the target file already exists, and the format supports multiple formats (like Java Key Store - JKS and JWK Set) the file is updated with the key you want to write.

The 2 last parameters are used depending on the type of the format.

* keyPassword: Used for encryption of the key, when this is used in the format or requested through a config parameter (for PEM format for example)
* filePassword: Used for the encryption of the file when file is encrypted as a whole (like with Java Key store). This password is also used for reading it first if the file already exists.

== Configuration

=== key.manager.class

default : **be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.LocalKeyManager**

The _KeyManager_ that supplies the request key to the KeySelector.

=== keys.location

default : **none**

The location of the Cryptographic keys. The value must start with **classpath:**, **file:** or **url:**. When the value points to a directory, all files (which are identified as containing a key, see _KeyResourceTypeProvider_) are read.

=== key.resourcetype.provider.class

default : **be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.reader.DefaultKeyResourceTypeProvider**

Defines the class which determines the key format of the resources.

=== lookup.password.class

default : **be.atbash.ee.security.octopus.keys.reader.password.ConfigKeyResourcePasswordLookup**

Defines the class which supplies the passwords for encrypted storage of keys

=== key.pem.encryption

default : **PKCS8**

Defines the encryption of the (RSA only?) private key when written to a PEM formatted file. Valid values ora PKCS1, PKCS8 and NONE (meaning no encryption of the key at all and just BASE64 encoded)

=== key.pem.pkcs1.encryption

default : **DES-EDE3-CBC**

Defines the default PKCS#1 encryption used. Valid values are defined according the following rules.

    algorithm names composed from 3 parts glued with hyphen.
    The first part determines algorithm, one of AES, DES, BF and RC2.
    The second part determines key bits and is used for AES and optionally for RC2.
       For AES it is possible to use values 128, 192 and 256.
       For RC2 64, 40 can be used or nothing - then value 128 is used.
    The last part determines the block mode: CFB, ECB, OFB, EDE and CBC.
    Additionally EDE3 can be used in combination with DES to use DES3 with EDE.

    Examples:
      AES-192-ECB
      DES-EDE3.
